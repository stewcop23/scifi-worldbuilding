### Conditions

not great

#### Ending

The three families are locked in conflict, Family 2 tries to keep making alliances with Family 1, at some point in the story they will successfully form an alliance. However Family 1 feeds family 2 the wrong info (because they realize that Family two is giving their info to Family 3). this ends up with Family 1 ending the conflict.
