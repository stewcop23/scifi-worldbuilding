### John (One For All)

John is a conglomeration of parts of other robots, created by a group of fighters who aren't part of the three families.

John incorporates weapons and tools from other robots that have been repurposed.

the entire body is made up by all of these weapons (ie: only a small processing core in the middle to give it consciousness). the entire body has several appendages that rotate around a central structure.

A similar thing goes for the head, it is made up of 3 different types of lens':

1. Wide angle lens (camera that John usually uses(suburb resolution and framerate))
2. Telephoto lens (used for looking long distances (duh))
3. Infrared camera (used in the dark, or when looking for hiding enemies)

## The war

### Conditions

not great

#### Ending

The three families are locked in conflict, Family 2 tries to keep making alliances with Family 1, at some point in the story they will successfully form an alliance. However Family 1 feeds family 2 the wrong info (because they realize that Family two is giving their info to Family 3). this ends up with Family 1 ending the conflict.
